# Example README
The source fort the project is divided into 3 categories, the MCU code, the FPGA code, and the matlab code.

## FPGA 

The FPGA directory contians the developement folder, devBranch which is a Radiant project. Due to not having git on the lab computers, different directory were duplicated during developement to save progress. The final iteration is shared here.

## MCU

The MCU directory contains a Segger ARM project for developement of the C code. 

## MatLab

The MatLab directory contains the matlab files and corresponding generated text files. This is used to generate the wave tables and simulate FM.
